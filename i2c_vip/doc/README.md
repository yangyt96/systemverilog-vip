# I2C VIP

## Overview

`i2c_vip` is a lightweight I2C Verification IP written with SystemVerilog
classes and verified with VUnit. It follows the same direct VIP-to-VIP style as
`uart_vip` and `spi_vip`, so the master and slave VIPs can be connected through
a shared I2C interface without a DUT.

The VIP currently includes:

- An open-drain I2C interface with resolved `scl` and `sda`
- A master VIP with single-byte `write_byte` and `read_byte` APIs
- A slave VIP with matching `expect_write` and `respond_read` APIs
- 7-bit addressing
- ACK/NACK checking
- Wrong-address NACK checking
- Transaction timeout protection
- Transaction logging to the simulator CLI
- A VUnit testbench with write, read, and continuous read coverage

## Main Components

### `i2c_if.sv`

Defines the shared open-drain I2C bus:

- `scl` and `sda` are `tri1`, so they pull high when nobody drives low
- The master and slave each expose low-drive control signals

### `I2CMasterVIP`

The master VIP generates start and stop conditions, serializes the 7-bit
address plus R/W bit, and checks ACK/NACK.

Main APIs:

```systemverilog
master_vip.write_byte(address, data, address_ack, data_ack);
master_vip.read_byte(address, data, address_ack);
```

### `I2CSlaveVIP`

The slave VIP waits for a start condition and responds when the address and R/W
bit match its configured address.

Main APIs:

```systemverilog
slave_vip.expect_write(data, address_match);
slave_vip.respond_read(data, address_match, master_ack);
```

## Running the Simulation

From the project root:

```bash
python3 i2c_vip/tb/run.py
```

With the provided Docker image:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work/i2c_vip/tb modelsim:20.1 python3 run.py
```
